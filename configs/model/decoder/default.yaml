# Decoder capacity increased to make room for the increased frequency range (I am running with 
# a Vocoder trained on 24KHz audio, 100 bins, and 12KHz f_max): 
# Decoder model size 23.4M params

# Changed from [256, 256]
# I must have attention_head_dim * num_heads == channels so the attention will cover all channels.
channels: [320, 320, 320]

# This model does not show a lot of overfitting, so I can use the original value of 0.05.
dropout: 0.05

# It is best to keep this as a power of 2 for performance
# I also tried with attention_head_dim = 80 and num_heads = 4 
attention_head_dim: 64

# Increased from 1, to capture more acoustic details.
# This makes training and inference slower.
n_blocks: 2

num_mid_blocks: 2

# Changed from 2
num_heads: 5
