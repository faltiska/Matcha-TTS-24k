# CFM / Diffusion improvement 

## 1. The "Beta" Schedule (Shifted Sampling)
Instead of weighting the loss (which keeps the gradients the same but scales them), try changing **which** timesteps the model sees more often.
In mel-spectrogram generation, the model often struggles with the fine details that emerge near destination.
Instead of `torch.rand`, sample  from a **Beta distribution**.
This forces the model to spend more "brain power" on the complex parts of the trajectory.

```
# Instead of t = torch.rand(...)
# alpha > 1 shifts sampling towards t=1 (the target)
# alpha=1.5 or 2.0 is a good starting point
dist = torch.distributions.Beta(1.5, 1.0) 
t = dist.sample([b, 1, 1]).to(mu.device)
```

# Validation tools like WER, UTMOS

Evaluating a TTS model like Matcha-TTS usually falls into three buckets: 
**Intelligibility** (does it say the right words?) 
**Fidelity** (how close is it to the original file?) 
**Naturalness** (does it sound like a human?)

I have already fidelity using MCD, and I am using it to compare progress over multiple checkpoints.
Here is how you can calculate the other metrics using Python.

### 1. Intelligibility: Word Error Rate (WER)

WER measures how well an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model can "understand" your synthesized speech. 
If the ASR model can't transcribe it correctly, a human probably won't either.

* **Tools:** `openai-whisper` (for transcription) and `jiwer` (for the calculation).

### 3. Naturalness: Predicted MOS (Mean Opinion Score)

Historically, MOS required paying 20 humans to rate audio from 1–5. 
Today, we use AI models trained on those human ratings to "predict" the score. 
**UTMOS** is currently one of the most reliable models for this.

* **Tool:** `UTMOS` (via GitHub or Hugging Face).

### Summary Table of Metrics

| Metric          | Category           | Comparison Type    | Good Score                    |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| **WER**         | Intelligibility    | Reference Text     | < 5%                          |
| **MCD**         | Fidelity           | Ground Truth Audio | Lower is better (e.g., < 5.0) |
| **MOS (UTMOS)** | Naturalness        | Absolute (No Ref)  | > 4.0                         |
| **SEC**         | Speaker Similarity | Reference Speaker  | > 0.8 (Cosine Sim)            |
